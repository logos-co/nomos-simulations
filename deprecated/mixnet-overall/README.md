## Project Structure

- `cmd`: CLIs to run the simulation and analyze the results.
- `sim`: Simulation that runs the NomMix defined in the `protocol` package.
- `protocol`: Core NomMix protocol implementation, which is going to be moved to the [nomos-repos](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-specs) repository once verified by simulations.
- `framework`: Asynchronous framework that provides essential async functions for simulations and tests, implemented with various async libraries ([asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html), [Î¼Sim](https://usim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), etc.)

## Features

- NomMix protocol simulation
- Performance measurements
  - Bandwidth usages
  - Message dissemination time
- Privacy property analysis
  - Message sizes
  - Node states and hamming distances

## Future Plans

- More NomMix features
  - Temporal mixing
  - Level-1 noise
- Adversary simulation to measure the robustness of NomMix

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-simulations.git
cd nomos-simulations/mixnet
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

Copy the [`config.ci.yaml`](./config.ci.yaml) file and adjust the parameters to your needs.
Each parameter is explained in the config file.
For more details, please refer to the [documentation](https://www.notion.so/NomMix-Sim-Getting-Started-ee0e2191f4e7437e93976aff2627d7ce?pvs=4).

Run the simulation with the following command:
```bash
python -m cmd.main --config {config_path}
```

All results are printed in the console as below.
And, all plots are shown once all analysis is done.

Please note that the result of node state analysis is saved as a CSV file, as printed in the console.

If you run the simulation again with the different parameters and want to
compare the results of two simulations,
you can calculate the hamming distance between them:
```bash
python -m cmd.hamming \
    all_node_states_2024-07-15T18:20:23.csv \
    all_node_states_2024-07-15T19:32:45.csv
```
The output is a floating point number between 0 and 1.
If the output is 0, the results of two simulations are identical.
The closer the result is to 1, the more the two results differ from each other.
```
Hamming distance: 0.29997
```
