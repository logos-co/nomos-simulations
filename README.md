# Nomos Simulations

This repository contains simulations related to the specifications and implementation of the Nomos Node.

## Directories

### [`simlib/netrunner`](./simlib/netrunner)
A generic simulations library used for analyzing network latency and bandwidth in Nomos-related systems.

### [`simlib/blendnet-sims`](./simlib/blendnet-sims)
Simulations focusing on latency, bandwidth, and anonymity in large networks of nodes. These simulations aim to evaluate and optimize network behavior in distributed systems.

### [`simlib/blendnet-sims/scripts`](./simlib/blendnet-sims/scripts)
A collection of scripts for analyzing results from Blendnet simulations. These tools assist in processing simulation data and generating insights.

### [`deprecated/mixnet-v1`](./deprecated/mixnet-v1)
Contains simulations and analyses for the Mixnet V1 specification, now deprecated. These files are preserved for reference and historical purposes.

### [`deprecated/node-carnot`](./deprecated/node-carnot)
Simulations and analyses for the Carnot consensus protocol, which are also deprecated. These files provide insights into earlier implementations and their limitations.
